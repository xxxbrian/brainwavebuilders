Week 9

Check in with Xin on wednesday in tutorial

Discussed allocation of work for rest of project

I'm working on testing frontend with jest
	had some issues setting up environment with our tech stack
	got environment working for components - so can do basic render testing
	will do a bunch of that to get coverage up

having difficulties with rendering whole pages in jsdom (just not actually rendering)
	once i figure this out, i can complete the tests and merge to main

need to help with presentation prep and report writing

My contribution lately has been low, I will reflect this in my peer review so that the others are not brought down by it.

========================================================================
Week 10

Helped out where possible working up to project demo on wednesday.

Ran into more roadblocks with testing, not running properly against our tech stack. current progress can be seen in branch BW-116-Testing-Attempt4 but is not in main.

Project demo wednesday, went in person to campus and met up as a group to rehearse and present. Went really well everyone did great!

Worked on implementation challenges section of report to see out the term.

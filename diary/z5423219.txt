# Week 1

- Setup the environment in-person for Cicy
- Decide on the roles and tech stack
- Decide on the weekly meeting schedule
- Github repository setup including branch protections and squash & merge strategy
- Planned and prepared existing infrastructure [*1] for this project.
    - Will be using proton as prod database & neutron as staging database.
    - Will be deploying the service on neutron, adding configuration
- Setup pre-commit hooks
- Setup CI that checks the naming of CI
- Setup Python VSCode typechecking preferences
- WIP: Setup branch deployment and blue-green deployment
    - Nginx configuration generation

For context:
I host a few websites and have some existing infrastructure setup, including:
- prod (primary): proton.universe.yyjlincoln.com
    - prod mySQL database
- staging (secondary): neutron.universe.yyjlincoln.com
    - staging mySQL database
- local dev: higgs.universe.yyjlincoln.com

# Week 2

Week 2 focused primarily on project setup. We organised team meetings, which
consists of WTMs (Whole Team Meetings) and Department Meetings and delegated
duties.

- Set up frontend and backend projects in a monorepo structure.
- Set up Prisma database workflow
- Discussed and started implementation with Brian about the custom RPC approach
- Set up Docker compose to containerise our app
- Deployment will be deferred, as the backup plan is to deploy on managed
infrastructure like Google Cloud or AWS
- Discussed the suitability of T3-app for the project
- Decided against tRPC due to its limitations
- Decided against React full-stack as it's not sufficient for a large-scale
project like this; A more traditional separate-server approach is more suitable
over serverless/function-driven approaches.

==
# Week 3

This week focused primarily on the proposal as it's due on Sunday Week 3.

- Work on designs and mainly the proposal
- Migrate and setup the repository to Github Classroom
- Discussed docker compose arch setup
- Helped Ethan set up his local docker on a Windows-based environment utilising WSL2
- Added nginx as a reverse proxy
- Discuss Type Generation with Brain
- Ran through a Jira setup session with everyone

==
# Week 4

This week focused primarily on the interface designs & rpc.

- Taking Brian's advice, reimplementeed the rpc
- Tested that it works
- Assisted other team members with their parts, including Steve
- Added docker setup for python env (for rpc code generation)

==
# Week 5

This week focused on the login page and sign up page, in preparation for Demo 1.

It also includes helping team members upskill - introducing the concepts of
reducers (for state management), controlled/uncontrolled forms.

Functionality wise:

- Implement the login page.

Project progressing well as expected. Minor slowdown in implementing the RPC
itself, but the long-term benefits will sure compensate for this.

==
# Week 6

Continue with the development of login page, and reviewing team members code.

Planning, drafting and prototyping a search feature that allows one to search
up forum posts. This is a technical investigation.

Feature-wise, the progress got slowed down by other assignments quite a bit. I'm
falling behind on the sprint work but I am not overly concerned. Expect more
progress soon.

==
# Week 7

Significant refactor of the frontend and added lots of forms.

Significant UI redesign for the frontend, significantly reduced code repetition
and improved code quality.

STANDUP:

Progress since last week:
Major refactoring to the dashboard pages, significantly reduced code redundancy
and designed the login in API. Redesigned the dashboard with @Steve Yang,
writing stub API code.

Announcements will be done before the demo; Forums will be done following that.

Blockers: not being blocked, but blocking @Steve Yang. Iâ€™ll merge in the
refactor shortly so Steve can work on redoing the dashboard elements.

Features that you worked on that could be presented in the demo:

Announcements.

Features that you are working on but cannot be presented yet:

Nothing else

==
# Week 8

Cleaned up some things after the demo.
Prepare for another (mental) sprint to get all features done for the final demo.
More planning works.

==
# Week 9

Finished forum, major clean up on pages.
Guiding through everyone to finish the code in the final stretch.

==
# Week 10

Final stretch, adding course books (materials) and deployment (local, prod)
Clean up of everything.
Prepare for the group report and presentation.

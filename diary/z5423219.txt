# Week 2

Week 2 focused primarily on project setup. We organised team meetings, which
consists of WTMs (Whole Team Meetings) and Department Meetings and delegated
duties.

- Set up frontend and backend projects in a monorepo structure.
- Set up Prisma database workflow
- Discussed and started implementation with Brian about the custom RPC approach
- Set up Docker compose to containerise our app
- Deployment will be deferred, as the backup plan is to deploy on managed
infrastructure like Google Cloud or AWS
- Discussed the suitability of T3-app for the project
- Decided against tRPC due to its limitations
- Decided against React full-stack as it's not sufficient for a large-scale
project like this; A more traditional separate-server approach is more suitable
over serverless/function-driven approaches.

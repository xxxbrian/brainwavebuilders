Week1:

Group Formation and Naming:
    We settled on the name "Brainwave Builders" for our group, which was confirmed during our online chat sessions.
Role Assignments:
    Each member's role was determined, with myself contributing to both backend and frontend development.
    Specific roles such as Scrum Master and Product Owner were assigned to Cicy and Sohee, respectively.
Meeting Schedule:
    We agreed upon our weekly meeting schedule to ensure regular progress checks and coordination.
Technology Stack Discussion:
    During our group meeting, we delved into discussions regarding the use of strongly typed languages like TypeScript and Go, compared to dynamically typed languages like Python, for our project.
    We evaluated their respective maintenance complexities and selected our tech stack accordingly.
Tech Stack Selection:
    We confirmed the use of a full-stack TypeScript setup, incorporating technologies such as Next.js, Prisma, React, MySQL, and tRPC for our project.
    This decision aligns with the group's consensus to utilize TypeScript for both backend and frontend development.
Project Setup:
    Utilizing the T3-App, I deployed our entire project's full-stack environment.
    This setup includes TypeScript, Next.js, Prisma, Tailwind CSS, tRPC, and NextAuth.js, following the group's decision to use these technologies.
Infrastructure Preparation:
    I deployed 6 local VM servers and modified BGP routing announcements to assign both IPv4 and IPv6 public addresses and network routes.
    Docker environments were installed on these servers to support our group's future needs.
Configuration:
    Configurations were made for strict TypeScript checking and other setup items, ensuring a robust development environment.

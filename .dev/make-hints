hints:
- If you want to work on the project, do `make up` then stop with `make down`.
- If you want to run an optimised build of the project, do `make run-local`.
- If you want to run a production build of the project, do `make run-prod`.
    This requires explicit environmental variable setup.
    Check out local.env for the secrets required, then provide them before running `make`.
    Alternatively, secrets are read programmatically through .dev/secrets/production.env.
